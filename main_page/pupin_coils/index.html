        <p class="indent">Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work
            of the
            English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The
            importance
            of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph
            (AT&amp;T),
            making him wealthy. Although AT&amp;T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had
            their own
            development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own
            patent.
            AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to
            greatly
            extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
